# AudioInputPlugin Restructure - Summary

## What Was Done

The AudioInputPlugin has been restructured from loose files into a proper Capacitor plugin package. This eliminates all manual Xcode configuration steps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Plugin Package Structure
```
plugins/audio-input-plugin/
├── package.json              # Plugin metadata & Capacitor config
├── AudioInputPlugin.podspec  # iOS dependency management
├── README.md                 # Plugin documentation
├── src/
│   └── index.ts             # TypeScript interface
└── ios/
    └── Plugin/
        ├── AudioInputPlugin.swift  # Native iOS implementation
        └── AudioInputPlugin.m      # Objective-C bridge
```

### 2. Updated Configuration Files
- **capacitor.config.ts**: Added `includePlugins: ['AudioInputPlugin']`
- **src/plugins/AudioInputPlugin.ts**: Now re-exports from the plugin package
- **setup.sh**: Added plugin linking step
- **README.md**: Added native mobile app section

### 3. Created Documentation
- **PLUGIN_SETUP.md**: Complete setup instructions for the automated process
- **RESTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md**: This file explaining the changes

### 4. Removed Old Files
- ❌ Deleted `SETUP_IOS_PLUGIN.md` (old manual setup guide)
- ❌ Deleted `setup-ios-plugin.sh` (old manual setup script)
- ⚠️ Old iOS plugin files in `ios/App/App/Plugins/` can be removed after sync

## Before vs After

### Before (Manual Setup) ❌
```bash
git pull
# Manually open Xcode
# Manually add AudioInputPlugin.swift to project
# Manually add AudioInputPlugin.m to project
# Manually configure bridging header
# Clean build folder
# Build project
```

### After (Automated Setup) ✅
```bash
git pull
npm install
npm link audio-input-plugin
npx cap sync ios
# Open Xcode and build - Done!
```

## Key Benefits

1. **No Manual Xcode Steps**: Plugin auto-configures through Capacitor
2. **Proper Package Structure**: Standard Capacitor plugin layout
3. **Automatic Dependency Management**: Podspec handles iOS dependencies
4. **Consistent Setup Process**: Works the same way as any other Capacitor plugin
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to update and maintain

## Setup for New Developers

New developers can now set up the project with:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd riff-layer-muse
./setup.sh
```

The setup script handles everything automatically!

## Migration Path

For existing setups:
1. `git pull` to get the new structure
2. Delete `ios/` folder: `rm -rf ios`
3. Run `./setup.sh` to set up with new structure
4. Open in Xcode and build

## Technical Details

### How It Works
- Capacitor reads `package.json` to identify the plugin
- The `capacitor` field in `package.json` points to iOS source
- `AudioInputPlugin.podspec` tells CocoaPods how to build the plugin
- `npx cap sync ios` automatically adds the plugin to Xcode project
- Swift bridging is handled automatically by Capacitor

### Plugin Registration
The plugin is registered through:
1. `capacitor.config.ts`: `includePlugins: ['AudioInputPlugin']`
2. Symbolic link: `npm link audio-input-plugin`
3. Native code: `CAP_PLUGIN(AudioInputPlugin, ...)`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Git pull the changes
2. ✅ Run `./setup.sh` for automated setup
3. ✅ Open in Xcode: `npx cap open ios`
4. ✅ Build and run - No manual steps needed!

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all steps in `PLUGIN_SETUP.md` were followed
2. Ensure `npm link audio-input-plugin` was successful
3. Verify `npx cap sync ios` completed without errors
4. Clean Xcode Derived Data if needed: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
